These are ideas I had for Planet Client[Alpha]0.3 but I didn't have time to implement it. You can delete this file, it's not that intresting.

Ideas for Planet Client

1. Make a shortcut menu that the user can create or delete.
/Folders
/Create & destroy shortcuts
/Reset the whole shortcut menu
/Rename shortcuts
/Save shortcuts
/Export & import shortcuts
/Pre shortcut folder with simple stuff in it that the user can have the option to delete
/Change color of default folder & shortcut image using Hex colors, RGB colors and also be able to revert back to the orgiinal image/color
/Change image
/Link to urls
/Options for putting a shortcut or folder shortcut on all pages, specific pages, all except any app pages, or none (default set to none)
/The ability to repeat a url on all pages, specific pages, all exept any app pages whenever you get on that page. Useful for when you want to do a bookmarklet or other stuff and repeat on selected shortcuts or folders
/Put a folder in a folder
/The ability to orginize your folders or pages by name or none
/In case theres a problem, make a page that can't be affected by shortcuts for example: Having a repeating shortcut that sends you to a page over and over and is set on all pages. Then you can go to the page and have access to turn off all repeating shortcuts or folders

2. Make a chat.
/Create rooms
/Delete rooms
/Owner can set a limit of people in a room
/Invite people with a code
/Change the invite code
/Be able to message any files and images
/Be able to download shared files in the chat
/Give a warning to the user when reciving files if they have the setting Warnings: on
/Be able to change your account image and name at any time
/Be able to change the background with themes or their own custom image
/Import and export a file that has the users stuff in case if they have to use a different computer/laptop
/Be able to join many rooms at once
/Have a menu that shows all of your rooms
?Maybe be able to have a voice mode
/Be able to screenshare

3. MediaBox.
/Be able to put YouTube URLs and run them on the web
/Get the Video, Title, and origin URL
/Let the user go to the original video
/Let the user be able to go to fullscrean or play it in picture in picture instead
/Let the user go back to the page by reloading the page
/Let the user be able to download the video in a mp4 format
/Give the user the option to be able to loop the video
?Maybe use LocalStorage in order to save the last 10 videos they watched
?Let the user be able to go to those videos and get the Video, Title, and origin URL
?Let the user remove specific videos and let the user be able to turn off history so it doesn't save it on LocalStorage
